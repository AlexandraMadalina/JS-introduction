# Doge-JS-Start

This is a class exercise created by our coach [Lambelin Rafael](https://github.com/rafaello104)


I follow this exercises during my training as JuniorWeb Developer at BeCode in maart 2019.
This is our initiation exercise in Javascript to manipulate DOM elements.

## Objectives

- Learn how to target elements
- Learn how to listen to events
## Instructions

- Create a simple html page with one button in the middle of the page
- Give this button the id "doge"
- Give this button the text Doggo

**Now we're going to do some modifications to the doge button, do them step by step:**

- When the page is finished loading, change the text to "Woof!"
- When you hover over the button "Woof!" should disappear and a little doggo icon should appear instead
- When you click the button a picture of a [doge](http://www.stickpng.com/cat/memes/doge?page=1) should show up somewhere on the page
- When you click the button again, the picture should disappear
